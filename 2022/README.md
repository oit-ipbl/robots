# Robots

- You have to do all the following `Pre-learning Assignments` .
  - There are some `challenge` tasks.
    - We strongly recommend all students read the documents on all challenge tasks because there would be many hints or important information helping you done the final task of this PBL.
- The following sample programs will help you develop more advanced robot programs. Work with your team members to try out the samples.

## Pre-learning Assignments
  - [Preparation](preparation/preparation.md)
  - [ROS basics](basics/basics_01.md)
  - [Robot control (1)](robot_control/robot_control_01.md)
  - [Robot control (2)](robot_control/robot_control_02.md)
  - [Robot control (3)](robot_control/robot_control_03.md)

## Sample Programs
  - [Robot facial expression](samples/robot_facial_expression.md)
  - [Sensor data](samples/sensor_data_01.md)
  - [Image Processing by Robot](samples/sensor_data_02.md)
  - [Make original simulation world](samples/original_world.md)
